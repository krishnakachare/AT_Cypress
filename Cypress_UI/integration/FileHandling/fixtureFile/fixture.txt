1. Js -->
   
   1. require(filePath)
   2. import statement

2. Cypress -->

# Command syntax =>  cy.fixture(filePath, encoding, options)

# we can store fixture data in cypress variable (Aliase) => .as(fixtData)

# cy.fixture(filePath, encoding, options)
  1. filePath --> File name (with or without extension)
  2. filePath --> If we have nested folder structure under fixture file then need to file path from fixture
